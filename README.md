# Sem 4 Notes 

This repo consists of notes for the courses that I am taking as Mech sophomore at IIT Bombay. Part of it is running notes during the classes. Other part is the gist that I understand when I read the topic.
Free to use them to your liking. Also I suggest you to check the sections of the courses to avoid any confusion.

Course | Section
-------|----------
MA 214 | S2
ME 206 | S1
ME 213 | -
CS 213 | -


These notes have not been thoroughly proofread (may do it during exams), so you can expect some typos and grammar mistakes. 
There also might be some errors in the theory. I would highly appreciate it, if you could point them out to me. 

You can contact me at nvishal1510@gmail.com or ~~whatsapp~~ signal me. 

A request to the reader - If you see any notes lagging too far behind the course content, hit me with a firm message to study (please be gentle :sweat_smile:).

Writing notes in LaTex has been inspired from [@aryamanmaithani](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani) whose [MA 105](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-105-tut) and [MA 106](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-106-tut) tuts which have been very helpful during my freshie year.
